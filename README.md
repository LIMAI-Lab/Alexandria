Open source, all purpose FREE Research Magazine, backed up with Blockchain technology.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>## WHY?
>This project aims to lead the scientific comunity to a higher level of virtous cooperation cycle.
We acknowledge that today, the scientific publication market is monopolized by a few agents, scientist are under-compensated for their roles as authors and reviwers, and accessibility to papers is limited or even restricted. All these characteristic are related and fundamented by the current system. The proposed solution then is a radical revolutionary change.
>
>## HOW?
>To drive the system into a better democratic state, this project aims to accomplish the following goals:
>1. Ensure **free of charge and free access to all the papers in this platform**. In other words, being a Reader has no conditions.
>2. Ensure a Peer Review validation of the published work, backed by the Blockchain technology.
>3. Enable **Authors** to **recieve direct profit from their publications**.
>4. Enable **Reviwers** to **recieve direct compensation** for their job.
>5. Ensure the only condition to become an Author and or a Reviwer is a criteria based on accademic competency and merit.
>6. Ensure that the rates assotiated to publish are established by the market.
>7. All the logic and the code is Open Source.

## Dynamics

Below we explain how the system works from the three possible perspectives: Reader, Author, Reviwer.

### Reader

The simplest way to be involved in the community by consuming the articles. 
- We require the user to create an account to certify it is not a bot.
- The Reader can search for articles across the whole database without restriction and download (read) free of charge as many as it wants.
- There will be a daily download quota to prevent overload. 
- Multiple downloads of the same article will not count as new downloads to prevent biasing the article read-popularity.

### Author

If you want to publish your work in this platform, you will have to become an Author. In order to do so you will have to provide further information that validate your qualifications, and nationality such as ID, college title, etc.

The Author pays the fee to start the Peer Review process which in turn enables it to complete the following steps:
1. add other authors,
2. select the contact-author,
3. upload the draft v1 as pdf,
4. write title and resume,
5. add topic tags,
6. select the 3 candidate Reviwers.
At this point the smart contract has began and the authorship of the text is preserved for as long as the process is `in-progress`. The reviwers are sent the title ans resume to accept or reject being part of the review. If the reviwers reject, the contact author will be requested to provide another candidate. The time window for all 3 reviwers to accept is 14 days (continous), if in this time any of the reviewrs haven't accepted, the smart contract gets `canceled` (the pdf content get deleted and the authorship preservation revoked).
If all 3 reviwers have accepted, the contact author must provide the funds to pay the reviwers, which are frozen until the process reaches its end. The author has 2 business days to do this or the contract gets canceled.


can a company / organization be an author?

## Market

As implied by the user dynamics defined above, there is an emergent market from the synergy between authors and reviwers.
Unless the community votes otherwise, this platform will be ads-free and will survive only due to the Peer-Reviwes dynamic contributions.

The cost of starting the Peer-Review process is used to support the expenses associated with the BlockChain, the maintenance of the Server, the compensation to contributors to this code base and the retribution or payment to the authors dividens.
The fee shall be an accessible amount world-wide, stable with low fluctuations; we will provide a process to update the value afterwards, at first it will be 10U$D.
The fee is paid per article draft, regardless of the number of authors attached.
